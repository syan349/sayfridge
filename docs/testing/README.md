## Run tests

Run commands from `backend`. Uvicorn does not need to be running.

| Execution | Selection | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local full regression | 455 scenarios | `python -m pytest -v` |
| Local core check | 55 scenarios | `python -m pytest -v -m ci` |
| Automatic PR/main CI | Same core set | `python -m pytest -v -m ci --strict-markers` |
| Manual workflow dispatch | Full suite | `python -m pytest -v --strict-markers` |
| Database-free check | 122 scenarios | `python -m pytest -v -m "not postgres"` |

Database tests use real PostgreSQL. Locally, supply `TEST_DATABASE_URL` through the
process environment or ignored `.env.test`; never use the application database.
CI uses a disposable PostgreSQL 18 service, not Neon. Fixtures initialize an
isolated schema and clean it up after each test.

## CI selection policy

Use one test implementation for local and CI runs. Mark a small set covering
permissions, representative workflows, atomic failures, and concurrency risks.
Keep boundary variants in the full suite. The remaining 400 scenarios still run
in full regression; a core pass alone is not evidence of a full-suite pass.

| Feature | Core scenarios |
| --- | ---: |
| Authentication | 6 |
| Storage spaces | 16 |
| Catalog | 8 |
| Inventory | 8 |
| Inventory additions | 6 |
| Inventory consumption | 5 |
| Inventory reconciliation | 4 |
| Inventory discard | 2 |
| **Total** | **55** |

Use `@pytest.mark.ci` for a whole test or `pytest.param(..., marks=pytest.mark.ci)`
for selected parameters. The marker is registered in `backend/pytest.ini`;
there is no default filter. Check the actual selection with:

```bash
python -m pytest --collect-only -q -m ci --strict-markers
```

The required GitHub job remains `test-job`. Automatic/manual runs upload their
respective JUnit results. Run full regression locally before requesting review.

## Maintain reports

Name reports `Bxx[-Byy]_FEATURE_TEST_RESULTS.md`. Record the date, tested commit or
working tree, environment, commands, outcomes, and outstanding acceptance checks.
Keep detailed scenarios and historical timings in the feature reports, not this
index. Distinguish local results from remote CI. Update current counts here when
selection changes; test collection is the source of truth.
